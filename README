                     SOAP::Lite for Perl
                     ===================

SOAP::Lite for Perl is a collection of Perl modules which provides a simple 
and lightweight interface to the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) both 
on client and server side. 

To learn about SOAP, go to http://www.soaplite.com/#LINKS for more
information.

This version of SOAP::Lite supports a subset of the SOAP 1.1 specification.
See http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP for details. 

FEATURES

- Supports SOAP 1.1 spec. 
- Interoperability tests with different implementations: Apache SOAP, Frontier, 
  Microsoft SOAP, Microsoft .NET, DevelopMentor, XMethods, 4s4c, Phalanx, 
  Kafka, SQLData, Lucin (in Java, Perl, C++, Python, VB, COM, XSLT). 
- Provides COM interface. Single dll (standalone [2.5MB] or minimal [32kB]). 
  Works on Windows 9x/Me/NT/2K. Doesn't require ROPE or MSXML. 
  Examples in VB, Excel/VBA, C#, ASP, JavaScript, PerlScript and Perl. 
- Provides transparent compression support for HTTP transport. 
- Provides mod_soap module. Make SOAP server with a few lines in .htaccess 
  or .conf file. 
- Includes XML::Parser::Lite (regexp-based XML parser) which runs instead 
  of XML::Parser where Perl 5.6 runs (even on WinCE) with some limitations. 
- Includes XMLRPC::Lite, implementation of XML-RPC protocol on client and 
  server side. All transports and features of SOAP::Lite are available. 
- Supports multipart/form-data MIME attachments. 
- Supports circular linked lists and multiple references.

  it'll be accessible. 
- Has tests, examples and documentation to let you be up and running in no time.

PREREQUISITES

This library has been tested by the author with Perl versions 5.005 
and 5.6.0 on different platforms: Windows 98/2K, Solaris 2.6, Linux 2.2. 
Should run everywhere where Perl 5.004 or later runs.

Some modules within this package depend on other packages that are
distributed separately from Perl. It supposes that you have the
following distributions installed before you install SOAP::Lite:

  XML::Parser

  You may not follow this requirement as soon as you have XML::Parser::Lite 
  (included), which will run automatically on Perl 5.6 and later if 
  XML::Parser is not available.

Following modules will be loaded on demand only:

  XML::Parser::Expat (included with XML::Parser)
  MIME::Base64                                  
  URI (for HTTP/SMTP transport and autodispatch)
  HTTP::Daemon (for daemon server implementation, included with libwww-perl) 
  Apache (for mod_perl server implementation, included with mod_perl) 
  Net::POP3 and MIME::Parser (for POP3 server implementation)
  MIME::Lite (for SMTP client implementation)
  IO::File (for FTP client and IO server)
  Net::FTP (for FTP client)
  MIME::Parser (for MIME attachment support)
  Compress::Zlib (for compression support)

Following modules will be used for HTTP protocol only:

  LWP::UserAgent (included with libwww-perl) 
  HTTP::Request (included with libwww-perl) 
  HTTP::Header (included with libwww-perl) 
  HTTP::Status (included with libwww-perl) 
  Crypt::SSLeay (for HTTPS/SSL transfer)

These modules should be available on CPAN.

INSTALLATION

You install SOAP::Lite as you would install any perl module library,
by running these commands:

if you have CPAN.pm installed and are connected to the Internet

   perl -MCPAN -e shell
   > install SOAP::Lite

or even 

   perl -MCPAN -e 'install SOAP::Lite'

otherwise

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Use nmake instead of make on Windows platform.

DOCUMENTATION

See lib/SOAP/Lite.pm for an overview of the library. Documentation is 
included in modules and scripts. These are normally converted to manual 
pages and installed as part of the "make install" process.  You should 
also be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract and read 
documentation from the module files directly.

INCOMPATIBILITIES

Due to extensive interoperability tests and some interface changes
version 0.50 introduced possible incompatibilities with previous versions.
Check this list for more information if you are upgrading to version
0.50 or later.

- compression (406 => 415, compress => deflate)
  switched from 'compress' to 'deflate' to correctly describe used method.

- no string in Fault detail, updated faultsting
  previous versions put extended information about Fault as a string in 
  detail element (but only qualified subelements are allowed there). Current
  version will use faultstring for Fault description and detail for subelement
  you may provide. Faultstrings that can be returned from server side were
  updated to reflect these changes.

- changed namespace/encodingspace behavior and dropped ~C/~V prefixes
  dropped undocumented prefixes ~C/~V. Use encodingspace()/namespace().

- prefixes check
  current version will resolve all prefixes, so element <foo:bar/> won't
  be allowed unless you declared 'foo' prefix somewhere in outer elements.

- mustUnderstand check (DO_NOT_CHECK_MUSTUNDERSTAND)
  SOAP server will fail message that has Header with mustUnderstand attribute
  set to 'true' and no actor attribute or actor attribute with specific
  "..../next" value. You may disable this check by specifying 
  $SOAP::Constants::DO_NOT_CHECK_MUSTUNDERSTAND = 1;
  in your server code right after 'use SOAP::Lite' directive.

- 200OK handling
  some servers return Fault message with 200OK code. Current version will
  look into the message for Fault element and will call on_fault()
  handler in this case also.

- charset in content-type (DO_NOT_USE_CHARSET)
  current version will specify charset in content-type header for HTTP
  protocol. Some toolkits don't understand such headers and may fail
  your resuest. Use:
  $SOAP::Constants::DO_NOT_USE_CHARSET = 1;
  in your client code to disable it. See t/21-public.t for example.

- XML::Parser::Lite (DO_NOT_USE_XML_PARSER)
  current version will try to load XML::Parser first and then load 
  XML::Parser::Lite. If for any reason you don't want to load XML::Parser
  you may specify it with:
  $SOAP::Constants::DO_NOT_USE_XML_PARSER = 1;
  in your server code right after 'use SOAP::Lite' directive on client or
  server side.

- changed order of parameters in deserializer (as_TYPE)

- methods as_TYPE/as_CLASS in de/serializer do not alter case
  using as_TYPE/as_CLASS specify names exactly as class name in deserializer 
  and serializer.

- simple arrays and hashes (not objects) are not blessed anymore during
  deserialization. Shouldn't break any code, but let me know if it does.

LIMITATIONS

- No support for multidimensional, partially transmitted and sparse arrays 
  (however arrays of arrays are supported, as well as any other data structures, 
  and you can add your own implementation with SOAP::Data). 
- Limited support for WSDL schema. 
- XML::Parser::Lite relies on Unicode support in Perl and doesn't do entity 
  decoding. 
- Limited support for mustUnderstand and Actor attributes. 

SUPPORT

Questions about how to use this library should be directed to the SOAP 
mailing list (http://discuss.develop.com/soap.html). Bug reports and 
suggestions for improvements can also be sent there. This mailing list is 
also the place for general discussions and development of the SOAP protocol 
itself. 
Feel free to send mail directly to author with your comments, suggestions, 
bug reports and complaints.
