SOAP::Lite for Perl is a collection of Perl modules which provides a simple 
and lightweight interface to the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) both 
on client and server side. 

This version of SOAP::Lite supports a subset of the SOAP 1.1 specification
and has initial support for SOAP 1.2 specification.
See http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP for details. 

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

This library has been tested by the author with Perl versions 5.005 
and 5.6.0 on different platforms: Windows 98/2K, Solaris 2.6, Linux 2.2. 
Should run everywhere where Perl 5.004 or later runs.

PREREQUISITES

Some modules within this package depend on other packages that are
distributed separately from Perl. It supposes that you have the
following distributions installed before you install SOAP::Lite:

  XML::Parser
  MIME::Base64                                  
  URI
  libwww-perl

Following modules will be loaded on demand only, and are considered optional:

  Crypt::SSLeay     HTTPS/SSL support
  Apache            mod_perl server implementation (included with mod_perl) 
  Net::POP3         POP3 server implementation
  MIME::Lite        SMTP client implementation
  IO::File          FTP client and IO server
  Net::FTP          FTP client
  MQSeries          MQSeries transport
  Net::Jabber       Jabber transport
  FCGI              FastCGI server implementation
  IO::Socket::SSL   SSL support for TCP transport
  MIME::Tools       MIME attachment support
  DIME::Tools       DIME attachment support
  Compress::Zlib    HTTP compression support

These modules should be available from CPAN (http://search.cpan.org/).

INSTALLATION ON UNIX

You install SOAP::Lite as you would install any perl module library,
by running these commands:

If you have CPAN.pm installed and are connected to the Internet

   > perl -MCPAN -e 'install SOAP::Lite'

From the command line, try the following:

   > perl Makefile.PL
   > make
   > make test
   > make install

INSTALLATION ON WIN32 PLATFORMS

   > perl Makefile.PL
   > nmake
   > nmake test
   > nmake install

ACTIVESTATE USERS

It is important that the same version of Perl is used to build the module, as
used to run the module. Otherwise, you may experience page faults in some
instances. Some people have found the following thread helpful in resolving
this:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soaplite/message/1371.

If this does not help, you may consider trying the following:

Build Lite.dll and perlapp using the same distribution. You can build Lite.dll
using the make-com-minimal and make-com-standalone batch files (found in 
the "examples/COM/" directory of the SOAP-Lite distribution package).

DOCUMENTATION

See lib/SOAP/Lite.pm for an overview of the library. Documentation is 
included in modules and scripts. These are normally converted to manual 
pages and installed as part of the "make install" process.  You should 
also be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract and read 
documentation from the module files directly.

SUPPORT

Questions about how to use this library should be directed to the SOAP 
mailing list (http://discuss.develop.com/soap.html). Bug reports and 
suggestions for improvements can also be sent there. This mailing list is 
also the place for general discussions and development of the SOAP protocol 
itself. 

Feel free to send mail directly to author with your comments, suggestions, 
bug reports and complaints.
