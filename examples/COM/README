                          SOAP::Lite for COM interface
                          ============================

SOAP::Lite for COM interface gives you ability to access SOAP services
from your COM applications. Examples in Visual Basic, Excel/VBA, Perl,
JavaScript and ASP are provided. 

Interface comes in two versions: standalone and minimal.
Both versions DOES NOT require ROPE.dll, MSXML.dll or listener.asp (for ASP).
Both versions were tested on Windows 98 and 2K, but should work on Windows 9x, 
ME, NT, 2K.
Minimal version requires Perl installation, but comes with minimal size (32k).
Standalone version doesn't require ANYTHING (including Perl), but comes
as one big dll (2.5M).

Standalone:    http://www.soaplite.com/download/SOAP-Lite-COM-standalone-0.46.zip
Perl required: http://www.soaplite.com/download/SOAP-Lite-COM-perl-required-0.46.zip

You may create your own version (all source code and batch files are provided),
but it'll require PerlCtrl utility that comes as part of Perl Development Kit
from ActiveState (http://activestate.com/). Interface could be create ONLY on
Windows NT or 2K, but will work on any Windows.

INSTALLATION

To register the DLL:

  regsvr32 Lite.dll

You can now try out the example programs.

VISUAL BASIC EXAMPLES

remote.vbs and temper.vbs connect to remote services, delayed stock 
quotes and temperature conversion.

local.vbs connects to local ASP server.

VISUAL BASIC, PERL AND JAVASCRIPT EXAMPLE

These examples (states.vbs, states.pl, states.html) connect to the local 
SOAP server and call service that will return name of the state.

MICROSOFT EXCEL EXAMPLE

Open the Excel (states.xsl) document. Be warned, this document contains
macroses, so you can get the warning. 
If you want to run examples you need to enable macroses. For those who
don't trust anybody code of macroses is provided in states.vba file, so
they can disable macroses and add them from this file.

By default this example will connect to local SOAP server 
(see VISUAL BASIC SERVER EXAMPLE). You may alter the address by 
changing parameter for proxy() method.

Supply a number of state and click 'Get State Name' button.

VISUAL BASIC SERVER EXAMPLE

You may start local SOAP server by running soap.vbs script. By default
server will accept requests on 'http://localhost/', but you can modify
this URL. Probably you'll also need to modify dispatch_to() parameters
where you can specify path to your Perl modules.

ASP SERVER EXAMPLE

Example of ASP SOAP server is provided. This implementation doesn't 
require ROPE or MSXML dlls, so all that you need is register Lite.dll 
and put soap.asp in appropriate place (for example, c:\inetpub\wwwroot\).
Now you can point your SOAP requests to http://localhost/soap.asp.
